## One Liners

Any joke can be a one-liner with enough semicolons.

- If doctors were like software engineers, they would say things like “Have you tried killing yourself and being reborn?”
- “Debugging” is like being the detective in a crime drama where you are also the murderer.
- Programming is like sex. One mistake and you have to support it for the rest of your life.
- 1/3 of US bandwidth is used by Netflix. The rest is used by `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`
- There are three kinds of lies: Lies, damned lies, and benchmarks.
